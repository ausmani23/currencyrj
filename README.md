# Abolition of What?

This repository contains the code that generates results and figures 'Abolition of What?' by Christopher Lewis and Adaner Usmani. 

To replicate our results, you will need to: 

1. Download R, which is open-source software that will allow you to run the file 'aow.R'.
1. Download the source data. We do not store these on the Github, because of space constraints. You can download the relevant files by visiting [this link](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/dg3i6ac0lnd6gzg/AAAdPhvB4pDYLfcMQCpMmg2ba?dl=0). 
2. Create an 'output' folder in the same directory as the 'code' directory. All figures and calculations are output to that folder. 

Please contact Adaner if you have any questions.
