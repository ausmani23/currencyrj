# The Currency of Racial Justice

This repository contains the code that generates results and figures 'The Currency of Racial Justice'

+ currency_summarize.R generates Figure 1
+ reparations_01_implement.R implements race-based reparations, of various kinds
+ reparations_02_summarize.R summarizes the results, generating Table 1 and Figures 2 and 3

To replicate our results, you will need to: 

1. Download R, which is open-source software that will allow you to run the .R files.
1. Download the source data. We do not store these on the Github, because of space constraints.
2. Create an 'output' folder in the same directory as the 'code' directory. All figures and calculations are output to that folder.
